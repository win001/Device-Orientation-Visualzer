This Python program runs a local server at your device's IP address on port 5001. It serves a basic web page that uses the `deviceorientation` event in your browser to capture your device's orientation data.

According to the MDN Web Docs, the `deviceorientation` event is triggered when new data is available from the device's orientation sensor. This sensor provides information about the device's orientation relative to the Earth's coordinate frame, typically using a magnetometer.

The program processes the orientation data—alpha, beta, and gamma angles—by converting them into Cartesian coordinates. It then uses Matplotlib to plot these coordinates in a 3D space, allowing you to visualize the device's orientation dynamically.
